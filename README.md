# Module 11 - Express Note Taker

In this assignment, using the provided index files, I created a server.js file to handle api calls coming from the router.js file, referenced in the principle index.js file with all the instructions to construct the fully functional web application.

- I used a router.get call to pull in information from the index.js,
- followed by a router.post call to define the new data going into the web application,
- along with a uuid function to generate a unique ID and create each new note as a clickable button.
